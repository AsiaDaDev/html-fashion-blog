  <p>Being fashionable doesn't take much. It's all about keeping things balanced and showcasing you're individuality. <br>
  However, if you still feel a bit lost check out some quick tricks to looking good no matter what.</p>
  
  <h2>Black Face Masks a Must</h2>

  <p>Face masks have become a necessary accessory within the last year. 
    Due to the fact that a face mask won't harm you, and can even be a helpful addition if you're suffering from a little confidence issues, there's no reason not to stock up. <br>
    Unless you're going for a coordinated color scheme then consider choosing a black face mask on your next outing.
    Black masks not only go with anything you may be wearing but they can even help your face look a little slimmer.</p>
  
  <h2>Belt Trumps Baggy</h2>

  <p>Considering sagging your pants around town? Well, you may want to reconsider. <br>
     Sagging may have been a common fashion trend in the early 2000s, but its fallen out of favor with most lately.
     Instead of risking you're pants falling to your ankles grab a properly sized belt with a plain or stylized buckle, depending on your preference.</p>
